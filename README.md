# Synchronized Bash Scripts on Login `.bash_sync`

These bash files get downloaded every time I log into my servers. Like that, I can maintain the `.bash_sync` in one place.

## Installation

```bash
wget -qN https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonnitto/bash/master/bash.sh -O syncBashScript.sh; source syncBashScript.sh
```
